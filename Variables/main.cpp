 * C++ supports the object-oriented programming
 * Standard C++ programming is divided into three parts
 * 1. The core library includes the data types, variables and literals, etc.
 * 2. The standard library includes the set of functions manipulating strings, files, etc.
 * 3. The standard template library(STL) includes the set of methods manipulating a data structure.
 * 
 * Lines beginning with a hash sign (#) are directives for the preprocessor.
 * They are not regular code lines with expressions but indications for the compiler's preprocessor.
 * Using: you are going to use it
 * Variables cannot start with any special characters or digits except underscores
